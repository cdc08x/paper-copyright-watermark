  abstract     = {Nowadays, business processes are increasingly supported by IT services that produce massive amounts of event data during the execution of a process. This event data can be used to analyze the process using process mining techniques to discover the real process, measure conformance to a given process model, or to enhance existing models with performance information. Mapping the produced events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process mining results. In order to accomplish this mapping with low manual effort, we developed a semiautomatic approach that maps events to activities using the solution of a corresponding constraint satisfaction problem. The approach extracts Declare constraints from both the log and the model to build matching constraints to efficiently reduce the number of possible mappings. The evaluation with an industry process model collection and simulated event logs demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach and its robustness towards non-conforming execution logs.},

This type of models describes processes on the basis of temporal constraints. Every behavior that does not violate such constraints is allowed, and such characteristic has proven to be suitable for representing highly flexible processes. One way to test a process discovery technique is to generate an event log by simulating a process model, and then verify that the process discovered from such a log matches the original one. For this reason, a tool for generating event logs starting from declarative process models becomes vital for the evaluation of declarative process discovery techniques. In this paper, we present an approach for the automated generation of event logs, starting from process models that are based on Declare, one of the most used declarative modeling languages in the process mining literature. Our framework bases upon the translation of Declare constraints into regular expressions and on the utilization of Finite State Automata for the simulation. An evaluation of the implemented tool is presented, showing its effectiveness in both the generation of new logs and the replication of the behavior of existing ones. The presented evaluation also shows the capability of the tool of generating very large logs in a reasonably small amount of time, and its integration with state-of-the-art Declare modeling and discovery tools.},

Mining processes that operate in an environment of high variability is an ongoing research challenge because various algorithms tend to produce spaghetti-like models. This is particularly the case when procedural models are generated. A promising direction to tackle this challenge is the usage of declarative process modelling languages like Declare, which summarise complex behaviour in a compact set of behavioural constraints. However, Declare constraints with branching are expensive to be calculated.In addition, it is often the case that hundreds of branching Declare constraints are valid for the same log, thus making, again, the discovery results unreadable. In this paper, we address these problems from a theoretical angle. More specifically, we define the class of Target- Branched Declare constraints and investigate the formal properties it exhibits. Furthermore, we present a technique for the efficient discovery of compact Target-Branched Declare models. We discuss the merits of our work through an evaluation based on a prototypical implementation using both artificial and real-world event logs.},

Existing discovery techniques verify the satisfaction of candidate constraints over the log, but completely neglect their interactions. As a result, the inferred constraints can be mutually contradicting and their interplay may lead to an inconsistent process model that does not accept any trace. In such a case, the output turns out to be unusable for enactment, simulation or verification purposes. In addition, the discovered model contains, in general, redundancies that are due to complex interactions of several constraints and that cannot be solved using existing pruning approaches. We address these problems by proposing a technique that automatically resolves conflicts within the discovered models and is more powerful than existing pruning techniques to eliminate redundancies. First, we formally define the problems of constraint redundancy and conflict resolution. Thereafter, we introduce techniques based on the notion of an automata-product monoid that guarantee the consistency of the discovered models and, at the same time, keep the most interesting constraints in the pruned set. We evaluate the devised techniques on real-world benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The declarative modeling of workflows has been introduced to cope with flexibility in processes. Its rationale is based on the idea of stating some basic rules (named constraints), tying the execution of some activities to the enabling, requiring or disabling of other activities. What is not explicitly prohibited by such constraints is implicitly considered legal, w.r.t. the specification of the process. Declarative models for workflows are based on a taxonomy of constraint templates. Constraints are thus instances of constraint templates, applied to specific activities. Many algorithms for the automated discovery of declarative workflows associate to each constraint a support. The support is a statistical measure assessing to what extent a constraint was respected during the enactment(s) of the process. In current state-of-the-art literature, constraints having a support below a user-defined threshold are considered not valid for the process. Thresholds are useful for filtering out guesses based on possible misleading events, reported in logs either because of errors in the execution, unlikely process deviations, or wrong recordings in logs. The latter circumstance can be considered extremely relevant when logs are not written down directly by machines reporting their work, but extracted from other source of information. Here, we present an insight on the actual capacity of filtering constraints by modifying the threshold for support, on the basis of real data. Then, taking a cue from the results performed on such analysis, we consider the trend of support when controlled errors are injected into the log, w.r.t. individual constraint templates. Through these tests, we demonstrate by experiment that each constraint template reveal to be less or more robust to different kinds of error, according to its nature.},

The discovery of declarative process models is useful when a process works in an unpredictable and unstable environment since several allowed paths can be represented as a compact set of rules. One of the tools available in the literature for discovering declarative models from logs is the Declare Miner, a plug-in of the process mining tool ProM. Using this plug-in, the discovered models are represented using Declare, a declarative process modelling language based on LTL for finite traces. In this paper, we use a combination of an Apriori algorithm and a group of algorithms for Sequence Analysis to improve the performances of the Declare Miner. Using synthetic and real life event logs, we show that the new implemented core of the plug-in allows for a significant performance improvement.},

This fine-grained indicator is then used to decide whether a candidate constraint supported by the analyzed event log is indeed relevant or not. Unfortunately, this notion of relevance has never been formally defined, and all the proposals existing in the literature use ad-hoc definitions that are only applicable to a pre-defined set of constraint patterns. This makes existing declarative process mining technique inapplicable when the target constraint language is extensible and may contain formulae that go beyond pre-defined patterns. In this paper, we tackle this hot, open challenge and show how the notion of constraint activation and vacuous satisfaction can be captured semantically, in the case of constraints expressed in arbitrary temporal logics over finite traces. We then extend the standard automata-based approach so as to incorporate relevance-related information. We finally report on an implementation and experimentation of the approach that confirms the advantages and feasibility of our solution.},

Processes are specifically discussed from the angle of simplicity, i.e., how compact and easy to understand they can be represented. In most cases, organizations rely on imperative models which, however, become complex and cluttered when it comes to flexibility and optionality. As an alternative, declarative modeling reveals to be effective under such circumstances. While both approaches are well known for themselves, there is still not a deep understanding of their semantic interoperability. With this work, we examine the latter and show how to obtain an imperative model out of a set of declarative constraints. To this aim, we devise an approach leading from a Declare model to a behaviorally equivalent Petri net. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any declarative control flow can be represented by means of a Petri net for which the property of safety always holds true.},

In this paper, we propose an approach based on temporal logic query checking, which is in the middle between process discovery and conformance checking. It can be used to discover those LTL-based business rules that are valid in the log, by checking against the log a (user-defined) class of rules. The proposed approach is not limited to provide a boolean answer about the validity of a business rule in the log, but it rather provides valuable diagnostics in terms of traces in which the rule is satisfied (witnesses) and traces in which the rule is violated (counterexamples). We have implemented our approach as a proof of concept and conducted a wide experimentation using both synthetic and real-life logs.},

However, a large part of these techniques are focused on the analysis of the control flow perspective of a business process. Therefore, one of the challenges still open in this field is the development of techniques for the analysis of business processes also from other perspectives, like data, time, and resources. In this paper, we present a full-fledged approach for the discovery of multi-perspective declarative process models from event logs that allows the user to discover declarative models taking into consideration all the information an event log can provide.

However, in order to be viable in the long run, a process' performance has to be made evaluable. To enable this kind of analysis, the suggested approach in this idea paper builds upon the well-established notion of devil's quadrangle. The quadrangle depicts the process performance according to four dimensions (time, cost, quality and flexibility), thus allowing for a meaningful assessment of the process. In the course of this paper, a framework for the measurement of each dimension is proposed, based on the analysis of process execution data. A trailing example is provided that reflects the expressed concepts on a tangible realistic scenario.},

Current approaches to process redesign face this problem in one way or another, which makes rapid process improvement a central research problem of BPM today. In this paper, we address this problem by integrating concepts from process execution with ideas from DevOps. More specifically, we develop a technique called AB-BPM that offers AB testing for process versions with immediate feedback at runtime. We implemented this technique in such a way that two versions (A and B) are operational in parallel and any new process instance is routed to one of them. The routing decision is made at runtime on the basis of the achieved results for the registered performance metrics of each version. AB-BPM provides for ultimate convergence towards the best performing version, no matter if it is the old or the new version. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique by conducting an extensive evaluation based on both synthetic and real-life data.},

Thus, being able to monitor how such processes are performed, including portions carried out by service providers, is paramount. Yet, traditional process monitoring techniques present some shortcomings when dealing with inter-organizational processes. In particular, they require human operators to notify when business activities are performed, and to stop the process when it is not executed as expected. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing an artifact-driven monitoring service, capable of autonomously and continuously monitor inter-organizational processes. To do so, this service relies on the state of the artifacts (i.e., physical entities) participating to the process, represented using the E-GSM notation. A working prototype of this service is presented and validated using real-world processes and data from the logistics domain.},

As a consequence, constraints can be mined that are hardly interesting to users or even potentially misleading. In this paper, we build on the observation that users typically read and write temporal constraints as if-statements with an explicit indication of the activation condition. Our approach is called Janus, because it permits the specification and verification of reactive constraints that, upon activation, look forward into the future and backwards into the past of a trace. Reactive constraints are expressed using Linear-time Temporal Logic with Past on Finite Traces (LTLpf). To mine them out of event logs, we devise a time bidirectional valuation technique based on triplets of automata operating in an on-line fashion. Our solution proves efficient, being at most quadratic w.r.t. trace length, and effective in recognising interestingness of discovered constraints.},

  abstract  = {Blockchain technology opens up new opportunities for Business Process Management. This is mainly due to its unprecedented capability to let transactions be automatically executed and recorded by Smart Contracts in multi-peer environments, in a decentralised fashion and without central authoritative players to govern the workflow. In this way, blockchains also provide traceability. Traceability of information plays a pivotal role particularly in those supply chains where multiple parties are involved and rigorous criteria must be fulfilled to lead to a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate how to run a business process in the context of a supply chain on a blockchain infrastructure so as to provide full traceability of its run-time enactment. Our approach retrieves information to trace process instances execution solely from the transactions written on-chain. To do so, hash-codes are reverseengineered based on the Solidity Smart Contract encoding of the generating process. We show the results of our investigation by means of an implemented software prototype, with a case study on the reportedly challenging context of the pharmaceutical supply chain.},

  abstract = {Artful processes are those processes in which the experience, intuition, and knowledge of the actors are the key factors in determining the decision making. These knowledge-intensive processes are typically carried out by the “knowledge workers”, such as professors, managers, researchers. They are often scarcely formalised or completely unknown a priori, and depend on the skills, experience, and judgment of the primary actors. Artful processes have goals and methods that change quickly over time, making them difficult to codify in the context of an enterprise application. Knowledge workers cannot be realistically expected to instruct the assistive system by modelling their artful processes: it would be time-consuming both in the initial definition and in the potential continuous revisions. To make things worse, time is the crucial resource that usually knowledge workers indeed lack.
Despite the advent of structured case management tools, many enterprise processes are still “run” over emails. Thus, reverse engineering workflows of such processes and their integration with artefacts and other structured processes can accurately depict the enterprise’s process landscape. A system able to infer the models of the processes laying behind the email messages exchanged would be valuable and the result could materialise almost freely. This is the purpose of our approach, which is the core of this thesis and is named MailOfMine. Its investigation mainly resides in the Machine Learning area. More specifically, it relates to Information Retrieval (IR) and Process Mining (PM). We adopted well-known IR techniques in order to extract the activities out of the email messages.
We propose a new algorithm for PM in order to discover the temporal rules that the activities adhere to: MINERful. The set of such rules, intended as temporal constraints, constitute the so called declarative modelling of workflows. Declarative models differ from the imperative in that they do not explicitly represent every possible execution that a process can be enacted through, i.e., there is no graph-like structure determining the whole evolution of a process instance, from the beginning to the end. They establish a set of constraints that must hold true, whatever the evolution of the process instance will be. What is not explicitly declared to be respected, is allowed. The reader can easily see that it is better suited to processes subject to frequent changes, with respect to the classical approach.
From a more abstract perspective, this work challenges the problem of discovering highly flexible workflows (such as artful processes), out of semi-structured information (such as email messages).},

  abstract  = {Timely identifying flight diversions is a crucial aspect of efficient multi-modal transportation. When an airplane diverts, logistics providers must promptly adapt their transportation plans in order to ensure proper delivery despite such an unexpected event. In practice, the different parties in a logistics chain do not exchange real-time information related to flights. This calls for a means to detect diversions that just requires publicly available data, thus being independent of the communication between different parties. The dependence on public data results in a challenge to detect anomalous behavior without knowing the planned flight trajectory. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a prediction model that just requires information on an airplane's position, velocity, and intended destination. This information is used to distinguish between regular and anomalous behavior. When an airplane displays anomalous behavior for an extended period of time, the model predicts a diversion. A quantitative evaluation shows that this approach is able to detect diverting airplanes with excellent precision and recall even without knowing planned trajectories as required by related research. By utilizing the proposed prediction model, logistics companies gain a significant amount of response time for these cases.},

  abstract  = {Process discovery is the task of generating process models from event logs. Mining processes that operate in an environment of high variability is an ongoing research challenge because various algorithms tend to produce spaghetti-like process models. This is particularly the case when procedural models are generated. A promising direction to tackle this challenge is the usage of declarative process modelling languages like Declare, which summarise complex behaviour in a compact set of behavioural constraints on activities. A Declare constraint is branched when one of its parameters is the disjunction of two or more activities. For example, branched Declare can be used to express rules like “in a bank, a mortgage application is always eventually followed by a notification to the applicant by phone or by a notification by e-mail”. However, branched Declare constraints are expensive to be discovered. In addition, it is often the case that hundreds of branched Declare constraints are valid for the same log, thus making, again, the discovery results unreadable. In this paper, we address these problems from a theoretical angle. More specifically, we define the class of Target-Branched Declare constraints and investigate the formal properties it exhibits. Furthermore, we present a technique for the efficient discovery of compact Target-Branched Declare models. We discuss the merits of our work through an evaluation based on a prototypical implementation using both artificial and real-life event logs. },

  abstract  = {Declarative process models define the behaviour of business processes as a set of constraints. Declarative process discovery aims at inferring such constraints from event logs. Existing discovery techniques verify the satisfaction of candidate constraints over the log, but completely neglect their interactions. As a result, the inferred constraints can be mutually contradicting and their interplay may lead to an inconsistent process model that does not accept any trace. In such a case, the output turns out to be unusable for enactment, simulation or verification purposes. In addition, the discovered model contains, in general, redundancies that are due to complex interactions of several constraints and that cannot be cured using existing pruning approaches. We address these problems by proposing a technique that automatically resolves conflicts within the discovered models and is more powerful than existing pruning techniques to eliminate redundancies. First, we formally define the problems of constraint redundancy and conflict resolution. Second, we introduce techniques based on the notion of automata-product monoid, which guarantees the consistency of the discovered models and, at the same time, keeps the most interesting constraints in the pruned set. The level of interestingness is dictated by user-specified prioritisation criteria. We evaluate the devised techniques on a set of real-world event logs.},

During the second phase, queries are evaluated on that knowledge base, in order to infer the constraints that constitute the discovered process. After an outline of the overall approach and an insight on the adopted process modeling language, we describe in detail our discovery technique. Thereupon, we analyze its performances, both from a theoretical and an experimental perspective.

Since such models are not defined a priori by experts but rather inferred from real-life scenarios that actually took place, they are guaranteed to respect the true executions (often Business Process Management tools are used to show the discrepancy between the supposed and the concrete workflows). Moreover, such models can be shared, compared, preserved, so that the best practices might be put in evidence from the community of knowledge workers, to the whole business benefit. Finally, an analysis over such processes can be done, so that bottlenecks and delays in actual executions can be found out.

Models created from automatic process discovery are meant to summarize complex behaviors in a compact way. Therefore, declarative models do not define all permissible behavior directly, but instead define constraints that must be met by each trace of the business process. While declarative models provide compactness, it is up until now not clear how robust or sensitive different constraints are with respect to noise. In this paper, we investigate this question from two angles. First, we establish a constraint hierarchy based on formal relationships between the different types of Declare constraints. Second, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of noise on different types of declarative rules. Our analysis reveals that an increasing degree of noise reduces support of many constraints. However, this effect is moderate on most of the constraint types, which supports the suitability of Declare for mining event logs with noise.},

  abstract  = {Process mining aims at discovering processes by extracting knowledge from event logs. Such knowledge may refer to different business process perspectives. The organisational perspective deals, among other things, with the assignment of human resources to process activities. Information about the resources that are involved in process activities can be mined from event logs in order to discover resource assignment conditions. This is valuable for process analysis and redesign. Prior process mining approaches in this context present one of the following issues: (i) they are limited to discovering a restricted set of resource assignment conditions; (ii) they are not fully efficient; (iii) the discovered process models are difficult to read due to the high number of assignment conditions included; or (iv) they are limited by the assumption that only one resource is responsible for each process activity and hence, collaborative activities are disregarded. To overcome these issues, we present an integrated process mining framework that provides extensive support for the discovery of resource assignment and teamwork patterns.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, business processes are increasingly supported by IT services that produce massive amounts of event data during the execution of a process. These event data can be used to analyze the process using process mining techniques to discover the real process, measure conformance to a given process model, or to enhance existing models with performance information. Mapping the produced events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process mining results. In order to accomplish this mapping with low manual effort, we developed a semi-automatic approach that maps events to activities using insights from behavioral analysis and label analysis. The approach extracts Declare constraints from both the log and the model to build matching constraints to efficiently reduce the number of possible mappings. These mappings are further reduced using techniques from natural language processing, which allow for a matching based on labels and external knowledge sources. The evaluation with synthetic and real-life data demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach and its robustness toward non-conforming execution logs.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The aim of process discovery is to build a process model from an event log without prior information about the process. The discovery of declarative process models is useful when a process works in an unpredictable and unstable environment since several allowed paths can be represented as a compact set of rules. One of the tools available in the literature for discovering declarative models from logs is the Declare Miner, a plug-in of the process mining tool ProM. Using this plug-in, the discovered models are represented using Declare, a declarative process modeling language based on ltl for finite traces. However, the high execution times of the Declare Miner when processing large sets of data hampers the applicability of the tool to real-life settings. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new approach for the discovery of Declare models based on the combination of an Apriori algorithm and a group of algorithms for Sequence Analysis to enhance the time performance of the plug-in. The approach has been developed in a way that it is easy to be parallelized using two different partitioning methods: the search space partitioning, in which different groups of candidate constraints are processed in parallel, and the database partitioning, in which different chunks of the log are processed at the same time. The approach has been implemented in ProM in its sequential version and in two multi-threading implementations leveraging these two partitioning methods. All the new variants of the plug-in have been evaluated using a large set of synthetic and real-life event logs.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The domains of complex event processing (CEP) and business process management (BPM) have different origins but for many aspects draw on similar concepts. While specific combinations of BPM and CEP have attracted research attention, resulting in solutions to specific problems, we attempt to take a broad view at the opportunities and challenges involved. We first illustrate these by a detailed example from the logistics domain. We then propose a mapping of this area into four quadrants – two quadrants drawing from CEP to create or extend process models and two quadrants starting from a process model to address how it can guide CEP. Existing literature is reviewed and specific challenges and opportunities are indicated for each of these quadrants. Based on this mapping, we identify challenges and opportunities that recur across quadrants and can be considered as the core issues of this combination. We suggest that addressing these issues in a generic manner would form a sound basis for future applications and advance this area significantly.},

We first reflect how blockchains could be used in the context of the established BPM lifecycle and second how they might become relevant beyond.

  abstract  = {Declarative process modeling languages such as declare describe the behavior of processes by means of constraints. Such constraints exert rules on the execution of tasks upon the execution of other tasks called activations. The constraint is thus fulfilled both if it is activated and the consequent rule is respected, or if it is not activated at all. The latter case, named vacuous satisfaction, is clearly less interesting than the former. Such a distinction becomes of utmost importance in the context of declarative process mining techniques, where processes are analyzed based on the identification of the most relevant constraints valid in an event log. Unfortunately, this notion of relevance has never been formally defined, and all the proposals existing in the literature use ad-hoc definitions that are only applicable to a pre-defined set of constraint patterns. This makes existing declarative process mining techniques inapplicable when the target constraint language is extensible, and may contain formulae that go beyond the pre-defined patterns. In this paper, we tackle this open challenge, and show how the notion of constraint activation and vacuous satisfaction can be captured semantically, in the case of constraints expressed in arbitrary temporal logics over finite traces. Our solution relies on the annotation of finite state automata to incorporate relevance-related information. We discuss the formal grounding of our approach and describe the implementation thereof. We finally report on experimental results gathered from the application of our approach to real-life data, which show the advantages and feasibility of our solution.},

  abstract  = {A fundamental assumption of Business Process Management (BPM) is that redesign delivers refined and improved versions of business processes. This assumption, however, does not necessarily hold, and any required compensatory action may be delayed until a new round in the BPM life-cycle completes. Current approaches to process redesign face this problem in one way or another, which makes rapid process improvement a central research problem of BPM today. In this paper, we address this problem by integrating concepts from process execution with ideas from DevOps. More specifically, we develop a methodology called AB-BPM that offers process improvement validation in two phases: simulation and AB tests. Our simulation technique extracts decision probabilities and metrics from the event log of an existing process version and generates traces for the new process version based on this knowledge. The results of simulation guide us towards AB testing where two versions (A and B) are operational in parallel and any new process instance is routed to one of them. The routing decision is made at runtime on the basis of the achieved results for the registered performance metrics of each version. Our routing algorithm provides for ultimate convergence towards the best performing version, no matter if it is the old or the new version. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology and techniques by conducting an extensive evaluation based on both synthetic and real-life data.},
